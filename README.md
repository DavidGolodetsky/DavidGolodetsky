### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm David a Frontend developer based in Lviv, Ukraine.

Artistically inclined, with a bachelor's degree in history. I have the unique ability to combine my creative and technical skills in the programming projects that I work on. I am self-motivated, constantly learning, and experimenting with new technologies. I like to create stuff and share my experience with the community

In my work, I focus on creating clean and modern interfaces, and frontend logic. Currently, Iâ€™m interested in Vue.js, AWS, PWA, and Hybrid apps.

Besides, I enjoy traveling, photography, and playing board games ðŸ¤“
