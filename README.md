Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm David, a Front-end developer based in Lviv, Ukraine.

With a bachelor's degree in history and artistically inclined, I have the unique ability to combine my creative and technical skills in the programming projects that I work on. I am self-motivated, constantly learning, and experimenting with new technologies. I like to create stuff and share my experience with the community.

In my work, I focus on creating clean and modern interfaces, and front-end logic. Currently, Iâ€™m interested in Vue.js, AWS, PWA, and Hybrid apps.

Besides, I enjoy  photography, birding and playing board games ðŸ¤“
