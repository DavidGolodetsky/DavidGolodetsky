Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm David, a Front-end developer based in Lviv, Ukraine.

I am self-motivated, constantly learning, and experimenting with new technologies. I like to create stuff and share my experience with the community. In my work, I focus on creating clean and modern interfaces, and front-end logic. Currently, Iâ€™m interested in Vue.js, PWA, and Hybrid apps.

Besides, I enjoy photography and playing board games ðŸ¤“
